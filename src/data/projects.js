/**
 * Your Websites / Projects
 * -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * This is the ONLY file you need to edit to add, remove, or update the
 * websites shown on your Portfolio page.
 *
 * To add a new website, copy one of the objects below, paste it into the
 * array, and fill in your own details. That's it — it will automatically
 * show up on the site with filtering, a thumbnail, and a "Visit Website"
 * button.
 *
 * Fields:
 *  - id:          A unique number (just increase it by 1 for each new item)
 *  - title:       The name of the website / project
 *  - category:    Used for the filter buttons (e.g. "Web App", "E-Commerce",
 *                 "Landing Page", "School Project"). Reuse categories you've
 *                 already used to group similar projects together.
 *  - description: A short 1-2 sentence summary of what it does
 *  - url:         The live link to the website (include https://)
 *  - image:       (optional) Path to a screenshot, e.g. "/assets/img/portfolio/mysite.jpg".
 *                 Put the image file inside public/assets/img/portfolio/
 *                 Leave this blank/omit it to show an automatic placeholder
 *                 thumbnail instead.
 *  - tags:        (optional) An array of short skill/tech tags, e.g. ["React", "Node.js"]
